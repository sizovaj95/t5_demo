	"review": "I purchased a similar model of vacuum overseas, which was about the same cost and so light & easy to use with its own charging stand and great performance. So it encouraged me to purchase one for home as my Dyson which I love, is now becoming a little too heavy to take up & down stairs and generally cart around the house. As this was on special offer I thought it was worth it. My rating reflects the weight and ease of use. Cons: Much heavier than I'd like, and very top heavy when using. I'm also not keen on the articulation of the brush head, which seems to have a mind of its own, so I struggle to keep it straight, when I need to. Also emptying the bin is tricky as i need to use both hands to press a clip on each side to open the container...not easy for older hands, and when using the hand vac on the stairs it is a bit cumbersome and again also heavier than I'd like. Won't stand upright on its own when fully extended so need to lean it against furniture/wall etc. Pros: I like the two options for suction which work efficiently enough, and I like the fold down design, so it does take up a very small footprint. I Like the detachable hand vac (even though its heavy) it has a good assortment of attachments and the battery life is very good, easy 40 mins on full charge. To be honest if I hadn't used it I would have returned it, but too late now.",
	"summary": "It performs well, but is heavier and top-heavy than desired. The brush head articulation is problematic, and emptying the bin requires both hands. The hand vac is cumbersome, and it doesn't stand upright when fully extended. The two suction options are efficient, and the fold-down design is compact. The detachable hand vac has good battery life and attachments. The reviewer would have returned it if given the chance."

	"review": "I've been saving my pennies for a new cordless vac for a long time. Everyone has been raving about Shark so I did my research and made my choice and then waited excitedly. I paid almost Â£60 in extra duty buying from the UK as they're not readily available in Europe. My vacuum didn't arrive on the expected day, or the next, in fact it never arrived, so I had to order it again and wait again. The vacuum overall is ok. The folding storage system is fiddly (and hard to plug in the charger when it's upside down in storage mode) as is the removal and clipping back in of the dust box. It's not picking up all the crumbs etc immediately, I have to go over and over it. It's quite heavy on the arm too and very top heavy. Positives- the carpet function seems to be very good (although we have mainly all tiled floors) and so far the battery seems to be holding well.",
	"summary": "The vacuum is okay but has fiddly folding storage and dust box removal. It requires multiple passes to clean effectively and is heavy and top-heavy. The carpet function and battery performance are positives."

	"review": "We purchased this product for my partner who is now working from home. She wanted a stick hoover to be able to clean the room each day after work. We received this product late last night ( 26/03/23 ) and unbowed it. We initially had good thoughts of the hoover after hoovering one room. We then disconnected the pipe to add an attachment. After attempting to reconnect the pipe and main floor head, all of a sudden the lights at the front and the brush were not working in the head. We have sat and fiddled with this item for approx 30 minutes taking care to ensure everything was clean and connected properly to make sure there was no user error. However there wasn't. It was apparent the head was no longer receiving any electricity from the main unit. We started a refund and have sent back the item. In addition to this, the item is flimsy, cheaply made, has a loud brush that spins, and has an extremely small capacity. Don't waste your money, buy something else.",
	"summary": "The vacuum was purchased for daily cleaning but encountered issues after disconnecting the pipe. Lights and brush in the head stopped working despite troubleshooting. The item was returned due to poor quality, loud brush, and small capacity. Not recommended."

	"review": "This hover is very light, its free standing to charge in an upright positionwith provided plugs. The hoover breaks down to 3 sections and comes with several good attachments smaller heads and narrow pipe head etc the main pipe is height adjustable which is a great feature to have, the main head it low profile and easily gets under sofas etc. Easy to dismantle and clean out, with the dust filter having a thin sheet around it joined with velcro for easy removal and seems to work very well. The Bad : No options for wall hanging. The hoover has to be used in turbo mode constantly as the suction is abismal we have hard floors with carpet on the stairs and landing and it cant remover the dog hair effectivley from the carpet or any mud etc larger than 2 mill on any surface. The brushes on the main head have 2 types soft and stiff the stiff ones are too short to pull any dirt up and the soft ones seem too soft to work well on any surface even on turbo. This results in the batery only lasting about 10-15 mins which is not ideal. The clips to open the dirt container don't seem very robust nor do the ones on the join between the shaft and the main body, the one to connect the main shaft with suction head should have a tab that can be realeased with you're foot rather than groveling on the floor to hald a tab in and tugging the head off. After cleaning the filters and waste out its very fiddly to re-attach. This item has some good features on it but I'd not buy another as the suction is soooo very poor and thats its primary funtion after all.",
	"summary": "The vacuum is lightweight and comes with useful attachments. It has adjustable height, a low-profile head, and easy-to-clean filters. However, it lacks wall-hanging options and has weak suction, especially for pet hair and larger debris. The battery lasts only 10-15 minutes, and the clips and connections are not robust. Overall, not recommended due to poor suction."

I found the suction to be sufficient to clean both carpet and lvt floors and the roller works well to catch anything it can. The weight is lighter than I expected considering that it houses a battery and the battery itself allows me to vacuum all my rooms on high power. Waste disposal is very easy and I find that the dust tries to clump up making it even easier to empty. Can't find anything to complain about in all honesty, highly recommended",

Great hoover so glad I did. I also have long hair which can be a problem for some hoovers, whilst this doesn't have anti wrap, it's so easy to clean off.

Also liked the fact that when you pressed the trigger you don't need to keep your finger on it. So we charged it up and off we went, or rather we didn't. We ran it over a rug that took our old vacuum about a minute to thoroughly clean. After 5 minute with this thing we gave up, put it back in the box and returned it. The rug still had lots of bits on it and clearly this vacuum (on max power) couldn't deal with it. We bought this after reading many good reviews. This is absolutely rubbish and the only recommendation I can give is don't buy it.",

I and my family members are impressed by this machine. Itâs light enough and nimble. Even on low suction mode it picks up all the dust and sand. At high suction mode it is very powerful but battery will drain a bit quicker. Only real negative I found compared with our previous branded cordless cleaner is a station with all the bits and pieces on. This one only comes with a piece of plastic where the vacuum cleaner with long brush attachment would lean on. So we have to get a box to have all the smaller bits together. Still 5stars from better. Very good value vs performance. 3 year warranty has been activated as well. Recommended.",

So I replaced it with this product..the battery won't last you as long as the expensive brands possibly but the suction is as good as any others. The only thing so far after a couple of times using it the settings are the suction starts at lowest setting and you have to swipe to get the power up .It would be best tobe on full suction as default and reduce power where required for more delicate jobs and save battery life but you would find yourself turning it up full every time. The bracket for wall mounting is awful..after mounting on wall the hoover would of fallen straight off..it will attach but a little finger push would have ot fall to the floor so beware..iv left mine on utility room surface instead..not as space saving but nice and safe. Impressed with the vacuum itself so far though.",

	"review": "*EDIT - After months of use I still stick by my original review, however... I have a serious peeve with the filter. I've come to realise there is no way to empty this vacuum cleanly. Because the filter gathers hair and dust this clumps around the barrel and makes emptying the bin a messy ordeal. You have to remove the filter by hand when emptying the bin to ensure everything is out and end up with a hand that looks like it has been dipped in an urn! For that I've taken away 2 stars from my review.* Having previously owned two cordless Dysons I was looking for something different as I felt both had design flaws and weren't worth the hundreds of pounds price tags. Knowing Hoover to be a good old fashioned brand and reading multiple positive reviews I thought I'd take a chance as the price seemed very reasonable too. Well I'm glad I did! Much smoother than my Dysons, better suction, lightweight and I find I'm now happy to whip the vacuum around rather than getting frustrated at the lack of suction and constant up keep. The on board tools are also a huge bonus as I was getting fed up of being back and forth for the tools on my old model. Also love the little lights. Give it a go!",
	"summary": "This Hoover vacuum cleaner proves to be a worthwhile alternative to more expensive brands. It offers better suction, smoother operation, and convenient on-board tools.

	"review": "I bought this Hoover as I was finding my main Dyson cleaner rather unwieldy after suffering a broken ankle. Itâs got great suction and charges in about six hours. The tools are a little limited, the crevice tool (stored in the underside of the unit) is handy, but rather too short for the gaps I need it for and the small brush is good for dusting off edges of furniture and the like. The main floor attachment is super for both carpet and hard floors, and I was pleasantly surprised how easily it picked up bits of fluff and hair. Some people might find the unit a little heavy using as a hand held on stairs, but overall itâs a great machine and well worth the money. Iâll probably still keep the Dyson for now, but I donât think itâll get used so often and this Hoover will be useful for vacuuming out the car too.",

The manual (dreadful) has little of help. It states charge for 24 hours before use - wonder how much energy that costs? My problem is it was easy to assemble the hoover stick and large brush on the end, but I can't dismantel them.

	"review": "The suction is poor. More like a dust brush. Not picking up dirt from the floor. The accessories are a medium quality plastic. Not very durable but will not break on first use either. It is lightweight, easy to manover around. It is mice that has the accessories inside so you can carry them around. The battery is charged separately and it's fairly easy to store it. The hair will wrap around the brush ( if it happens to pick any as the suction is a bit rubbish) . Even with the tool attached will mot pick up small break crumble from first time. It is easy to empty the dust bin, but will not be that easy to wash it. From some thin carpets will pick up more, but for medium to thick carpets will stand no chance. A dust brush will do more. I sent it back to the seller. It says sold by Amazon, but actually is a company named Electrical Experience and their customer service is less than 1 star. I had a lot of trouble returning this. They even called be to tell me that this should be used as a second vaccum for easy jobs like stairs and things like this. Well nowhere is saying that on the description... Also I've been receiving a message from them that made no sense. 2 weeks to issue a lable and still waiting for a refund after 3 weeks of struggles. So be careful!",

	"review": "Well where do I start as there so much wrong with this hoover branded cordless. Iâm firstly shocked that hoover allowed it to have its logo on such a poor vacuum. The design is bulky very top heavy for those who are elderly and the suction power is practically none existent I could suck in myself more powerfully and Iâve been on 20 year 20 pack a day habit. PThe 25 min run time I disagree itâs more like 15 and although dysons earlier models ran at 6mins on full power that was all that was needed due to the few passes needed to pick up large amounts dust/debris due to its suction power. I still own a dyson v59 animal but this had flaws with its bin splitting were you insert the tools so after my fifth bin at Â£21 a pop I saw this. I So wish I hadnât. Unfortunately like the review I saw saying it was a free gift in return for a honest review I wish I had been given this luxury instead of parting with my hard earned money. The bin on this hoover is large as stated but still you have the problem of clicking the button and nothing falls out as itâs all wrapped and wedged between the inner bin and internal components but this will be after months of hoovering due to its poor pick up of dust/debris . My dyson with brush bar attachment lifts the pile of my carpet and same with the brush tool for stairs & soft furnishings you can see every pass I make but this hoover model just glides around you can feel no resistance as the suction is so weak and the pile remains flat. Thereâs no option to lower the brush bar or either a boost mode you get what it produces a whole lot of nothing-ness & the on board crevice tool thatâs even a bigger joke it fits within the handle which you lift a clipped down cover which is fiddly to get out and hard to unlatch the lid. It is the shortest crevice tool Iâve seen the open end is so narrow a grain of rice would block up the crack Iâve never seen a crevice tool as small ,thin and the crack so narrow it is also useless to get down the sides of car seats as itâs too short once on the bulky head of the cleaner. Removing the long shaft to make it handheld for crumbs on work tops etc is not easy either and the slide down brush is stiff to get it to the end of the nozzle to use as handheld then this has a massive opening with thick bristles all around the outer edge and all the same length that when used it simply pushes the bits/crumbs/dust away on the floor with nothing actually getting sucked up. If you put your hand over to feel the suction power you will be so disappointed. Itâs shocking why did I choose this model. I hope to make sure others donât make the same mistake. My sister as just purchased a vax model with a plus-minus button on the handle for suction power & wow itâs better than dyson and even on the lowest bar of her vax cordless the suction is more powerful than this bulky useless hoover model. Do I need the hassle of returning no I will give it away to a local charity shop and hopefully after using this and reviewing it I can make other would be buyers more knowledgeable and hopefully choose a different brand. Please donât waste your time & money on this cordless. Iâve tried uploading a few images one of which is the pathetic little crevice tool but for some reason Iâm unable to see this option on my edit. Anyway Iâve measured my dyson crevice tool once clicked into the machine and itâs 21cm 8.5 inches in total this gets well into crevices like car seats etc.Now the crevice tool on this hoover 8cm 3.5 inches and the narrow crevice opening length of 1 inch compared to just under 2 inch on dyson with a much wider width enough for larger debris to suck into the bin and like I stated above a grain of rice would Block this crevice tool due to the narrow width.",

One major thing to highlight the brush head is advertised as being motorised however after a couple of tries the brush only worked spasmodically.

Fantastic service I would recommend it.",

Handheld section is also lightweight and bonus with the holder for the attachments that sits on the pole. I've only rated it 4 overall mainly because I do find I have to pull out all the hair from the vacuum head each use, to keep it working well. You also get a spare hepa filter with this. Battery life is pretty good, guess it depends how much time you spend vacuuming, but charges well. Overall would buy this again.",

After using for a month, I donât think itâs powerful enough and it definitely doesnât hold its charge for 45 mins on high suction, and it needs to be to get the job done.

It is powerful with great suction and the battery lasts long than I expected even on highest suction power.

It's soooo smooth and you think it's not picking anything up. But the motor and suction is so powerful that it is! The quality is supreme! As when are attaching and detaching various parts, there's a slight pressure then 'click'. This is indeed quality. Which ensures parts where they connect don't break over time with continued use. As opposed to my Morphy Richards Supervac Gold (which I am replacing this with) which in less than a year of occasional use broke with ease.In comparison with the the old one. The Horniture S13 is just like a Dyson Monster but better because it's much lighter (and in my signature colour Red) and my old Morphy Richards Supervac Gold is like a Black & Decker Dustbuster!",

	"review": "I don't usually leave reviews but I'm so impressed with this hoover! This is my first cordless hoover, I have mobility issues and chronic pain and using our upright has become impossible so I thought I'd dive into modern life and give this cordless malarkey a shot! We hoovered with the upright on Sunday (now Wednesday) so I was expecting it to be a bit of a task for the cordless but I'm very pleasantly surprised at the power of this hoover. I have a human man, 6 year old very messy kid and a 4 legged fur ball kitty so this was mainly bought for crumbs and clean cat litter that the fur ball manages to get everywhere! Collected all the crap photographed before it ran out of battery, on full power around 30-40 mins which is a little frustrating but I planned on getting an extra battery anyway so no big deal. I also have quite a deep pile carpet and as most of these reviews mention hard floor I wasn't hopeful but I think the pictures show just how good it is! I was not expecing it to gather so much hair and fluff!! The light is awesome as it highlights all the crumbs and it didn't scare the living bejesus out of my cat which, considering its a noise she's not heard before (sounds different to the monster upright vax) is quite impressive. Anyway.. Buy this hoover, you will not be disappointed. Just have to edit to add how impressed I am after a few weeks,. Hoovering 3-4 times a week so it's not like this has built up, the amount of stuff this hoover picks up would legit rival Hoover's that cost 2 or 3 times what this one does, the battery power lasts plenty long enough and last 2 pics are taken afterhoovering just now even though it was yesterday as the child's room needed doing...that's just one room and then going over everywhere else to get anything I missed yesterday, absolute bargain!",

I find I am always having to use the boost setting to get the best vacuuming, but this depletes battery very fast. You can also notice a definite noise change when the suction inexplicably and consistently reduces mid-vacuum after ~3 minutes. You can just turn off and turn on the hoover to get back to original suction (or better), but it is a slight annoyance. It is lightweight and easy to pull out and use. Perfect for quickly sucking up a toddler's meal leftovers or a spill. Overall, it's a good little workhorse that does the job it needs to do. Thank you Honiture.

I'm still picking up hair after a person that left 1.5 months ago. If you see hair on the carpet, you can slowly go back and forth over it 20 times, then you'll bend over and go get it yourself. If you see a black thread from socks, you'll do the same. No matter what, this vacuum won't get it for you. I even tried picking it up and gently setting it down, then running over it. The vacuum flattened it back into the carpet. It has a really soft, wide brush which instead of picking things up, flattens them in. The only thing it can get is dust, but to be fair so can any vacuum.",

	"review": "I should start off by saying I have never once in my life ever been excited for a vacuum cleaner or even impressed by one. However since buying this I can safely say that I have been quite astonished by it. Before I say how good this vacuum is, let me just give some context here: - Our old vacuum was a vax and it lasted years - Our old vacuum was also corded - We have a few pets in our house so there's lots of hair - Our house is 2 story so there's a lot of room to cover. With that out of the way, here's what I can say about this vacuum. I will start with the attachments. The attachments are amazing! Perfect tools for doing the right job such as: getting cobwebs out of the corner? Use the extension pole and the end with the brush and just simply remove them. Want to clean out the car? Well take off the extension pole and get the small motorised end piece and clean out the footwell with it. Lots of day to day mess on the floor? Put on the extension pole and use the normal end. This vaccine really is a jack of all traits because of the modular design of it that allows you to swap and change ends. Now I'm going to talk about the battery. There's not a lot to say about it because it's a battery but what I can say is that it has around 30-40 mins of use before it runs out and that 30-40 mins is more than enough time to get around a 2 story house. Its also just so convenient not having a cable pulling you back all the time aswell. The battery really gives you the freedom to move around with it everywhere. One of the features about this vacuum that I absolutely love is how easy it is to get pet hair out of the brushes on the bottom. Literally all you have to do is unscrew the barrel for the brush using a coin, pull it out, run some scissors down the fluted part of the barrel and then pull the hair off of the brush. It's literally that simple. Also when it comes to dumping the dirty out and into the bin, it's so effortless. Just unclip the chamber and then put it over a bin and then dump it. On average use I have to do this around twice per clean in the house. In summary, this vacuum is seriously one of the best ones I've ever seen. Sounds weird to be excited over one but it seriously is amazing. If you're looking for a vacuum, this is the one to go for.",

I emailed them a copy of my 3-year guarantee I had received from Vax. They arranged for the pickup of the vacuum and returned a new one within 5 days. I suppose, even though disappointed I can't complain too much. A little maybe but not worth bothering about here. My advice is keep the box (I didn't because I was sure a Vax wouldn't break down and had no room to store it) also register asap and keep your guarantee safe as safe can be.

It won't stand up on its own, so unless you bolt the stand onto the wall, it will flop over as the battery makes it very top heavy. The most frustrating thing, by far, is the container for the dirt. It fills quickly, so we know it's working well, but emptying it is a real chore. You have to get your fingers or a small stick to pull out the matted up dirt, pet hair, etc. and it needs emptying several times during use. I'd like to talk to the person who invented the container....I'll bet he/she had never really used it! We only have a small bungalow, one old dog, and no children, so I would expect it to be a bit more practical. I don't think we'll ever get this one again if it fails again.",

	"review": "I was really excited to try this vax hoover as I have the hard floor cleaner and can swap the batteries around. However if you're disabled or weak or elderly you're going to find this a struggle. The dust bucket is at the top and so is the battery and it's really heavy when it's all put together. The brush part is quite small and so easier to handle. You can separate it and use it as a handheld with attachments but it's still heavy for me. I thought the attachments were made from low quality plastic too. Also there is a bracket for the wall that needs screwing in and you have no choice but to use it. The hoover won't stand up on its own as it just falls over as soon as you let go. This is the worst bit and could easily fall over on your baby or dog. My son has hollow walls to and isn't allowed to screw anything into the wall. So if my walls were like that I'd have nowhere to keep this. The suction is good I've got no issues there but it's the rest of it unfortunately. It's a let down compared to the hard floor cleaner. If I had paid almost two hundred pounds for this I would have returned as it's just not suitable. I have parents in the annexe and we share appliances. My mother has arthritis and she just can't use this. I thought manufacturers were trying to be more inclusive but this does a rewind back many years. I've only given it three stars for the suction and it loses two stars on account that I can't use the thing.",

	"review": "I have had an older model cordless Vax & a cordless Dyson so itâs good to compare as well as review. The good thing about this model is that you have all the attachments you could need as standard. No need to purchase separately. The light on the brush bar only works when the brush is rotating. The instructions tell you that on hard floors, to not use the brush function so when vacuuming most of our home, the light function is not on as itâs stone or wood flooring. When vacuuming with the brush function off, I found that all the dog hair I was collecting stayed in the floor head & did not travel to the dirt collector. I had to use the brush function to get it to reach the canister. I found this odd as it called a Pace Pet. As in the title, the dirt canister is small. From the bottom to the max sign is only 4.5 cm compared to 7.5 cm on my Dyson. When you have large hairy dogs, even when vacuuming every day, it needs emptying very quickly. If you have a longer piled rug, the brush function stops. It doesnât like a shag pile. One of the biggest problems on my old Vax was that the hose that leads from the floor brush to the reach wand would split after about 6 months of use. It doesnât have a solid âelbowâ joint, but a flexible plastic tube. I had hoped that this would have been updated, but it looks the same. I hope perhaps the material has been amended so that it doesnât split. Having to buy a new floor head every 6 months can be expense that is not factored in when buying a new vacuum. The advantage over the Dyson is that you donât have to keep your finger on the âOnâ switch. Price wise, itâs not too bad for a cordless especially when according to the blurb, the battery can be used with other Vax products (not that I have any at the moment). To sum up, if you have a lot of hard floors & dogs that shed a lot of hair, this isnât the best, however, for a home that is mostly carpeted & maybe a cat or two, it will do the job.",
	"summary": "The Vax Pace Pet cordless vacuum comes with useful attachments, but the light on the brush bar only works when it's rotating. The small dirt canister fills up quickly, especially with pet hair. It struggles with longer piled rugs and has a potential issue with the hose splitting.

It is light, easy to use, doesnât take up a lot of room and can be wall-mounted, if you want it to be. It is versatile and can be used as a full-length vacuum, with just the pole, or reduced to a useful hand-held size. It comes with the tools that you would expect, and they are very easy to swap in and swap out. Itâs easy to empty and the filter is washable, which is a bonus. In terms of power, itâs not the most powerful vacuum, but given what it is and the size of the motor, you shouldnât expect it to be, and it is perfectly adequate. If you live in a reasonably sized house, with thick carpets, lots of people/children/pets in and out all day, and this is your only vacuum, my gut feeling is that itâs going to struggle to meet your demands, and it would be better to have a different vacuum for deep cleaning and this one for day-to-day as and when. If you have lots non-carpeted areas, I think this would be fine. I used it to cover a specified area and then went over the area again with my main vacuum; the main vacuum did pick up a few extra bits, but it was negligible, and less than I expected it to be.",
	"summary": "This cordless 3-in-1 vacuum cleaner is well-made, versatile, and easy to use. While it may not be the most powerful option, it is suitable for day-to-day cleaning and non-carpeted areas."

	"review": "This is a nice cordless vacuum at an affordable price. Very affordable and that comes with some compromises. Starting with the Cons, I need to say that the suction is not as good as I was hoping for. Is not doing great on carpets but is way better on hard floors. Collects hair easily as promised but mostly from the hard floor. On the carpet is harder. Especially carpets with long piles. It is a bit noisy (noisier than the one I have now) but nothing dramatic. The battery doesn't really last long but is already stated that it runs only for 35 minutes. That is because the battery is small and this is one of the main reasons this vacuum is so light. The compartment for the dust and bits is small too but this also reflects on the overall weight of the vacuum. Now as for the pros, it has a beautiful style. Aesthetically is very nice. Extremely light (because of the small battery) you can hold it with one hand and clean high ceilings, corners, spider webs, etc, without getting tired or sore arms. For someone who has less strength in arms is ideal. Comes with many accessories that can change easily and make this vacuum from a long one for floors to a small handheld one for your car or couch or just for that moment that something fell on the floor. It is something you can have handy without the need for loads of space. The filter is very good and washable so that helps a lot. The system is truly anti-tangle for hair and that is very good. Except for the head accessories, It comes of course with a base to mount on the wall (although not really essential) and its charger. You set it up extremely easily and you can change the parts easily as well. Is just a click. Overall this is a friendly budget vacuum that is to be used as secondary and for daily maintenance, especially with pets, and not for deep cleaning. This can be your second 'cheap and light' when you don't want out to take out the big one just for refreshment and maintenance.",
	"summary": "This affordable cordless vacuum has some compromises. It lacks strong suction on carpets but performs better on hard floors. The battery life is limited, but it's lightweight, aesthetically pleasing, and comes with various accessories for versatile use. It's ideal for quick maintenance and secondary cleaning tasks."

	"review": "Itâs early days yet, but so far this is a decent replacement for our little handheld. Itâs pretty light so much so that our 5yo can use it pretty comfortably, which Iâm not gonna lie is pretty handy. Iâm not sure the price tag of Â£109 is quite right, as things do feel a little basic. The hoover has 2 power settings, the long pole and power head attachment have led lights to help highlight your way to a tidy house. The power head has a fuzzy roller rather than the typical spiral brush which is a little odd, but it still works. These a clip that comes in the box to attach the multi reach tools direct onto the main pole. In all a handy light weight quick whip around, but donât expect it to be as good as your main squeeze.",
	"summary": "This lightweight cordless vacuum is a decent replacement for a handheld. It's easy to use, even for a child, and has LED lights for visibility. The power head has a unique roller design. It's suitable for quick cleanups but falls short compared to a full-size vacuum."

	"review": "I'm quite impressed with this vacuum. I also have a Dyson so of course I had to compare it to that. They are actually pretty similar, the biggest difference between them is just that this doesn't have a trigger. There is a button on the back that you press once to turn on, again for high power mode and again to turn off. Everything else is so similar to the Dyson that I wonder why they didn't add the trigger, maybe due to patents or something? It has many of the same features such as being easy to see how much has been collected in it and being easy to empty. It also looks really nice with a very appealing colour scheme and has plenty of accessories. My only concern would be the power, it's not quite as powerful as the Dyson but it doesn't feel far off, neither of them compare to a corded vacuum in terms of raw suction power. We are now using this one upstairs and the other one downstairs.",
	"summary": "This vacuum is impressive and comparable to a Dyson. It lacks a trigger but has similar features, including easy visibility of collected dirt, easy emptying, and a pleasing design. The power is slightly less than a Dyson but still effective. It's suitable for different floors."

	"review": "Unfortunately this seems to badly lack power for vacuuming carpets. It will do for a quick clean up but I wouldnât recommend it as a replacement for a corded vacuum cleaner. On hard floors itâs more than adequate and the brush roller does a good job of pulling in dust and debris where it can easily pick it up. The roller doesnât flick debris behind the unit which is something I have dealt with frequently using smaller vacuum cleaners. For hard floors only, this is perfect. The attachments are good enough for cleaning sofas(pet turbo attachment) and corners with the limited suction it has. All in all I would say this is pretty much perfect for say a caravan or hard floors only. It works on carpets but doesnât get deep enough into the carpet and the suction isnât strong enough to work effectively.",

	"review": "The build quality of this cordless vacuum cleaner is better than I was expecting. I have a steam mop from this make and itâs a bit rickety-feeling. This, however, seems sturdy enough and made from fairly chunky, solid-feeling plastic, with the exception of the covers for the dust container and filter, which do feel a little thin. At less than 2.4kg, itâs nice and light and easy to move round the house. Iâm not overly keen on the colour combination - which isnât blue and gold as titled, but blue and ROSE gold. There is definitely a pink tone to it. Although the product images make the main tube look lighter and silvery, in fact this too is rose gold. The vacuum collects dust into a smallish dust container built into the handle. The container opens and empties directly downwards, when a catch holding the container lid shut is released. The controls are straightforward, though I find the positioning and small size of the power button on the handle a bit awkward, and the handle itself could be more comfortable. I find the shaping of the handle pushes my hand down onto the blocky, hard-shaped battery holder. This is OK in use, but less powerful than other vacuums we own, and the motor seems quite whiny. We have a long-haired mini dachshund who sheds lots of tiny, fine red hairs and this wasnât particularly good at getting these out of the carpet. The HEPA 13 filter needs to be cleaned and washed regularly, and to ensure that itâs fully dry and dust doesnât get stuck to damp surfaces clogging it, this needs to be left for 24 hours after washing. Other vacuums require similar timeframes, but you can usually get a spare filter so that youâre not without your hoover for a full day - at time of writing nothing seems to be available for this model. The vacuum comes with a single 22.2v battery. This requires a 4-5 hour charge (the manual says 4 hours, the manufacturer website 4-5) for a maximum 35 minute run time. Unless I was doing a very cursory sweep over the middle of our floors just to freshen things up a bit, this run time isnât long enough to get round our house in one go and 4-5 hours is quite long to wait for the battery to recharge. I had a look for spares availability, but at time of writing I canât find any sign of spare batteries for this model even on the manufacturerâs website. The battery is separate from the machine rather than built in to it, and the battery can be removed to charge. The manual is somewhat confusing on this point, as it talks about âthe unitâ being able to be charged directly from the mains. However, the charging point is in the removable battery, rather than built in to the vacuum itself and the battery charges perfectly well when not attached to the vacuum (there are three little blue LED charge status indicator lights on the side of the battery. This is handy: since the battery can be removed for charging thereâs no need for the wall mount for the machine to be near a plug socket, so if e.g. you wanted to put this out of the way on the wall in a cupboard with no plug points, this is fine. Something I wasnât at all impressed by was the fact that this was marked in several places, even though itâs a brand new vacuum with every single piece separately wrapped in plastic. As soon as I got it out of its packet, I could see that there were little scrapes all over the battery, including long scuffs on the underside that make it look as though it had been repeatedly put in and out of a holder. I think on the whole this is an OK vacuum at the price point. It could be more powerful, and itâs annoying that run time canât be extended with a second battery. The handle could be more comfortable. This is fairly inexpensive at Â£109 for a newly-released, branded cordless vacuum, but isnât as good as similar devices by Karcher, Vax, GTech, or Levoit. Comes with a 1-year warranty as standard, extendable to 3 years via online registration. Pros: lightweight, Generally sturdy build, Easy to use, Battery can be charged separately, Up to 3 years warranty. Cons: Not as powerful as others, Several marks on the one I received, Currently no sign of spares for battery/filter, so long waits are needed for charging/drying time.",
