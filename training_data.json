	"review": "I purchased a similar model of vacuum overseas, which was about the same cost and so light & easy to use with its own charging stand and great performance. So it encouraged me to purchase one for home as my Dyson which I love, is now becoming a little too heavy to take up & down stairs and generally cart around the house. As this was on special offer I thought it was worth it. My rating reflects the weight and ease of use. Cons: Much heavier than I'd like, and very top heavy when using. I'm also not keen on the articulation of the brush head, which seems to have a mind of its own, so I struggle to keep it straight, when I need to. Also emptying the bin is tricky as i need to use both hands to press a clip on each side to open the container...not easy for older hands, and when using the hand vac on the stairs it is a bit cumbersome and again also heavier than I'd like. Won't stand upright on its own when fully extended so need to lean it against furniture/wall etc. Pros: I like the two options for suction which work efficiently enough, and I like the fold down design, so it does take up a very small footprint. I Like the detachable hand vac (even though its heavy) it has a good assortment of attachments and the battery life is very good, easy 40 mins on full charge. To be honest if I hadn't used it I would have returned it, but too late now.",
	"summary": "It performs well, but is heavier and top-heavy than desired. The brush head articulation is problematic, and emptying the bin requires both hands. The hand vac is cumbersome, and it doesn't stand upright when fully extended. The two suction options are efficient, and the fold-down design is compact. The detachable hand vac has good battery life and attachments. The reviewer would have returned it if given the chance."

	"review": "I've been saving my pennies for a new cordless vac for a long time. Everyone has been raving about Shark so I did my research and made my choice and then waited excitedly. I paid almost Â£60 in extra duty buying from the UK as they're not readily available in Europe. My vacuum didn't arrive on the expected day, or the next, in fact it never arrived, so I had to order it again and wait again. The vacuum overall is ok. The folding storage system is fiddly (and hard to plug in the charger when it's upside down in storage mode) as is the removal and clipping back in of the dust box. It's not picking up all the crumbs etc immediately, I have to go over and over it. It's quite heavy on the arm too and very top heavy. Positives- the carpet function seems to be very good (although we have mainly all tiled floors) and so far the battery seems to be holding well.",
	"summary": "The vacuum is okay but has fiddly folding storage and dust box removal. It requires multiple passes to clean effectively and is heavy and top-heavy. The carpet function and battery performance are positives."

	"review": "We purchased this product for my partner who is now working from home. She wanted a stick hoover to be able to clean the room each day after work. We received this product late last night ( 26/03/23 ) and unbowed it. We initially had good thoughts of the hoover after hoovering one room. We then disconnected the pipe to add an attachment. After attempting to reconnect the pipe and main floor head, all of a sudden the lights at the front and the brush were not working in the head. We have sat and fiddled with this item for approx 30 minutes taking care to ensure everything was clean and connected properly to make sure there was no user error. However there wasn't. It was apparent the head was no longer receiving any electricity from the main unit. We started a refund and have sent back the item. In addition to this, the item is flimsy, cheaply made, has a loud brush that spins, and has an extremely small capacity. Don't waste your money, buy something else.",
	"summary": "The vacuum was purchased for daily cleaning but encountered issues after disconnecting the pipe. Lights and brush in the head stopped working despite troubleshooting. The item was returned due to poor quality, loud brush, and small capacity. Not recommended."

	"review": "This hover is very light, its free standing to charge in an upright positionwith provided plugs. The hoover breaks down to 3 sections and comes with several good attachments smaller heads and narrow pipe head etc the main pipe is height adjustable which is a great feature to have, the main head it low profile and easily gets under sofas etc. Easy to dismantle and clean out, with the dust filter having a thin sheet around it joined with velcro for easy removal and seems to work very well. The Bad : No options for wall hanging. The hoover has to be used in turbo mode constantly as the suction is abismal we have hard floors with carpet on the stairs and landing and it cant remover the dog hair effectivley from the carpet or any mud etc larger than 2 mill on any surface. The brushes on the main head have 2 types soft and stiff the stiff ones are too short to pull any dirt up and the soft ones seem too soft to work well on any surface even on turbo. This results in the batery only lasting about 10-15 mins which is not ideal. The clips to open the dirt container don't seem very robust nor do the ones on the join between the shaft and the main body, the one to connect the main shaft with suction head should have a tab that can be realeased with you're foot rather than groveling on the floor to hald a tab in and tugging the head off. After cleaning the filters and waste out its very fiddly to re-attach. This item has some good features on it but I'd not buy another as the suction is soooo very poor and thats its primary funtion after all.",
	"summary": "The vacuum is lightweight and comes with useful attachments. It has adjustable height, a low-profile head, and easy-to-clean filters. However, it lacks wall-hanging options and has weak suction, especially for pet hair and larger debris. The battery lasts only 10-15 minutes, and the clips and connections are not robust. Overall, not recommended due to poor suction."

I found the suction to be sufficient to clean both carpet and lvt floors and the roller works well to catch anything it can. The weight is lighter than I expected considering that it houses a battery and the battery itself allows me to vacuum all my rooms on high power. Waste disposal is very easy and I find that the dust tries to clump up making it even easier to empty. Can't find anything to complain about in all honesty, highly recommended",

Great hoover so glad I did. I also have long hair which can be a problem for some hoovers, whilst this doesn't have anti wrap, it's so easy to clean off.

Also liked the fact that when you pressed the trigger you don't need to keep your finger on it. So we charged it up and off we went, or rather we didn't. We ran it over a rug that took our old vacuum about a minute to thoroughly clean. After 5 minute with this thing we gave up, put it back in the box and returned it. The rug still had lots of bits on it and clearly this vacuum (on max power) couldn't deal with it. We bought this after reading many good reviews. This is absolutely rubbish and the only recommendation I can give is don't buy it.",

I and my family members are impressed by this machine. Itâs light enough and nimble. Even on low suction mode it picks up all the dust and sand. At high suction mode it is very powerful but battery will drain a bit quicker. Only real negative I found compared with our previous branded cordless cleaner is a station with all the bits and pieces on. This one only comes with a piece of plastic where the vacuum cleaner with long brush attachment would lean on. So we have to get a box to have all the smaller bits together. Still 5stars from better. Very good value vs performance. 3 year warranty has been activated as well. Recommended.",

So I replaced it with this product..the battery won't last you as long as the expensive brands possibly but the suction is as good as any others. The only thing so far after a couple of times using it the settings are the suction starts at lowest setting and you have to swipe to get the power up .It would be best tobe on full suction as default and reduce power where required for more delicate jobs and save battery life but you would find yourself turning it up full every time. The bracket for wall mounting is awful..after mounting on wall the hoover would of fallen straight off..it will attach but a little finger push would have ot fall to the floor so beware..iv left mine on utility room surface instead..not as space saving but nice and safe. Impressed with the vacuum itself so far though.",

	"review": "*EDIT - After months of use I still stick by my original review, however... I have a serious peeve with the filter. I've come to realise there is no way to empty this vacuum cleanly. Because the filter gathers hair and dust this clumps around the barrel and makes emptying the bin a messy ordeal. You have to remove the filter by hand when emptying the bin to ensure everything is out and end up with a hand that looks like it has been dipped in an urn! For that I've taken away 2 stars from my review.* Having previously owned two cordless Dysons I was looking for something different as I felt both had design flaws and weren't worth the hundreds of pounds price tags. Knowing Hoover to be a good old fashioned brand and reading multiple positive reviews I thought I'd take a chance as the price seemed very reasonable too. Well I'm glad I did! Much smoother than my Dysons, better suction, lightweight and I find I'm now happy to whip the vacuum around rather than getting frustrated at the lack of suction and constant up keep. The on board tools are also a huge bonus as I was getting fed up of being back and forth for the tools on my old model. Also love the little lights. Give it a go!",
	"summary": "This Hoover vacuum cleaner proves to be a worthwhile alternative to more expensive brands. It offers better suction, smoother operation, and convenient on-board tools.

	"review": "I bought this Hoover as I was finding my main Dyson cleaner rather unwieldy after suffering a broken ankle. Itâs got great suction and charges in about six hours. The tools are a little limited, the crevice tool (stored in the underside of the unit) is handy, but rather too short for the gaps I need it for and the small brush is good for dusting off edges of furniture and the like. The main floor attachment is super for both carpet and hard floors, and I was pleasantly surprised how easily it picked up bits of fluff and hair. Some people might find the unit a little heavy using as a hand held on stairs, but overall itâs a great machine and well worth the money. Iâll probably still keep the Dyson for now, but I donât think itâll get used so often and this Hoover will be useful for vacuuming out the car too.",

The manual (dreadful) has little of help. It states charge for 24 hours before use - wonder how much energy that costs? My problem is it was easy to assemble the hoover stick and large brush on the end, but I can't dismantel them.

	"review": "The suction is poor. More like a dust brush. Not picking up dirt from the floor. The accessories are a medium quality plastic. Not very durable but will not break on first use either. It is lightweight, easy to manover around. It is mice that has the accessories inside so you can carry them around. The battery is charged separately and it's fairly easy to store it. The hair will wrap around the brush ( if it happens to pick any as the suction is a bit rubbish) . Even with the tool attached will mot pick up small break crumble from first time. It is easy to empty the dust bin, but will not be that easy to wash it. From some thin carpets will pick up more, but for medium to thick carpets will stand no chance. A dust brush will do more. I sent it back to the seller. It says sold by Amazon, but actually is a company named Electrical Experience and their customer service is less than 1 star. I had a lot of trouble returning this. They even called be to tell me that this should be used as a second vaccum for easy jobs like stairs and things like this. Well nowhere is saying that on the description... Also I've been receiving a message from them that made no sense. 2 weeks to issue a lable and still waiting for a refund after 3 weeks of struggles. So be careful!",

	"review": "Well where do I start as there so much wrong with this hoover branded cordless. Iâm firstly shocked that hoover allowed it to have its logo on such a poor vacuum. The design is bulky very top heavy for those who are elderly and the suction power is practically none existent I could suck in myself more powerfully and Iâve been on 20 year 20 pack a day habit. PThe 25 min run time I disagree itâs more like 15 and although dysons earlier models ran at 6mins on full power that was all that was needed due to the few passes needed to pick up large amounts dust/debris due to its suction power. I still own a dyson v59 animal but this had flaws with its bin splitting were you insert the tools so after my fifth bin at Â£21 a pop I saw this. I So wish I hadnât. Unfortunately like the review I saw saying it was a free gift in return for a honest review I wish I had been given this luxury instead of parting with my hard earned money. The bin on this hoover is large as stated but still you have the problem of clicking the button and nothing falls out as itâs all wrapped and wedged between the inner bin and internal components but this will be after months of hoovering due to its poor pick up of dust/debris . My dyson with brush bar attachment lifts the pile of my carpet and same with the brush tool for stairs & soft furnishings you can see every pass I make but this hoover model just glides around you can feel no resistance as the suction is so weak and the pile remains flat. Thereâs no option to lower the brush bar or either a boost mode you get what it produces a whole lot of nothing-ness & the on board crevice tool thatâs even a bigger joke it fits within the handle which you lift a clipped down cover which is fiddly to get out and hard to unlatch the lid. It is the shortest crevice tool Iâve seen the open end is so narrow a grain of rice would block up the crack Iâve never seen a crevice tool as small ,thin and the crack so narrow it is also useless to get down the sides of car seats as itâs too short once on the bulky head of the cleaner. Removing the long shaft to make it handheld for crumbs on work tops etc is not easy either and the slide down brush is stiff to get it to the end of the nozzle to use as handheld then this has a massive opening with thick bristles all around the outer edge and all the same length that when used it simply pushes the bits/crumbs/dust away on the floor with nothing actually getting sucked up. If you put your hand over to feel the suction power you will be so disappointed. Itâs shocking why did I choose this model. I hope to make sure others donât make the same mistake. My sister as just purchased a vax model with a plus-minus button on the handle for suction power & wow itâs better than dyson and even on the lowest bar of her vax cordless the suction is more powerful than this bulky useless hoover model. Do I need the hassle of returning no I will give it away to a local charity shop and hopefully after using this and reviewing it I can make other would be buyers more knowledgeable and hopefully choose a different brand. Please donât waste your time & money on this cordless. Iâve tried uploading a few images one of which is the pathetic little crevice tool but for some reason Iâm unable to see this option on my edit. Anyway Iâve measured my dyson crevice tool once clicked into the machine and itâs 21cm 8.5 inches in total this gets well into crevices like car seats etc.Now the crevice tool on this hoover 8cm 3.5 inches and the narrow crevice opening length of 1 inch compared to just under 2 inch on dyson with a much wider width enough for larger debris to suck into the bin and like I stated above a grain of rice would Block this crevice tool due to the narrow width.",

	"review": "Worst part is the charging time and usage on high speed. Charging time: almost 4hours (from zero) using the charger given in the box. Usage time (on full speed): 12 to 15 min MAX. Works ok on hard surface with single speed, however carpets needs max speed. Good fit for small area.",
	"summary": "The vacuum's long charging time and short usage time on high speed are major drawbacks. Works well on hard surfaces but requires maximum speed for carpets. Suitable for small areas."

	"review": "The vacuum is light so donât expect a feeling of deep clean however I am very satisfied with the results and the handheld part is so good on the stair. One major thing to highlight the brush head is advertised as being motorised however after a couple of tries the brush only worked spasmodically. I emailed the company and within one day had a reply informing me that they were sending a replacement I was amazed and true to their word the new machine arrived in 3 days. Fantastic service I would recommend it.",
	"summary": "The vacuum is lightweight and performs well, especially the handheld part on stairs. However, the motorized brush head had issues, but the company provided excellent customer service by promptly replacing the machine. Recommended."
